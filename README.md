# Museum-Software-System

This is a repository including a project conducted for the Introduction to Software Engineering class at McGill University. 

The project was done in groups of 6 teams, following the AGILE manifesto. 

The web application was first modeled using UMPLE. The backend was implemented in Java and the persistence layer built using postgreSQL and JPA. The front-end application was implemented using Vue.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

The application was developed using a test-driven development approach, and each component was tested using unit and integration tests. 

Our application's chosen architectural model was that of Model-View Controller architecture.
