## Project Description:
The museum of a small town needs our help to design a website so they can support their community and provide better services. The museum has ten rooms to display artwork and a storage room. Five of the ten rooms are large rooms and can fit 300 artworks, and the remaining five are smaller rooms that can only fit 200 artworks. The storage room of the museum is very large and can store an almost unlimited number of artworks.

The museum is managed by its owner who gets their own user account. The museum also has several employees, each of which gets their own account. Museum visitors can choose to create an account as well. Through their account the owner can manage and decide on numerous things related to the museum: opening hours, employee schedules, visitor fees, rental fees, hiring/firing employees, etc. Employees, on the other hand, can use their accounts to decide which artwork goes into which room and whether an artwork is on display (in a room) or in storage. The manager can do all the tasks that an employee can. Using a visitor account, a visitor can purchase museum passes, browse all artwork the museum owns, and request to take an item on loan. If a visitor wants to take an item on loan, they must pay a fee and this must be approved by an employee. However, not all items are available for loan.
